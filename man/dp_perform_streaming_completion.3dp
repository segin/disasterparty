.SH NAME
dp_perform_streaming_completion \- perform a streaming LLM completion request with a generic text callback

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <disasterparty.h>
.PP
.BI "int dp_perform_streaming_completion(dp_context_t *" context ", const dp_request_config_t *" request_config ", dp_stream_callback_t " callback ", void *" user_data ", dp_response_t *" response ");"

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B dp_perform_streaming_completion()
function sends a request to the configured LLM provider to generate a completion
and streams the response back token by token. This function is for use cases
where only the text content of the stream is needed.

The provided
.I callback
function will be invoked multiple times with text tokens as they are received.
When used with the Anthropic provider, this function internally parses the
detailed event stream and extracts only the text for the generic callback.
To receive detailed events from Anthropic, use
.BR dp_perform_anthropic_streaming_completion (3).

For OpenAI and Anthropic,
.I request_config->stream
must be set to
.BR true .

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 if the stream was successfully initiated and completed. Returns -1 on setup error.
