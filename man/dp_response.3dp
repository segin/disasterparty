.SH NAME
dp_response_t \- structure for holding an LLM API response

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <disasterparty.h>
.PP
.nf
typedef struct {
    dp_response_part_t* parts;
    size_t num_parts;
    char* error_message;
    long http_status_code;
    char* finish_reason;
} dp_response_t;
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B dp_response_t
structure holds the result of an API call made by a completion function.
It contains either the successful response data or error information. Its
contents must be freed with
.BR dp_free_response_content (3).

.SH MEMBERS
.TP
.B dp_response_part_t* parts
For non-streaming responses, this will be an array of response parts. Currently, only a single text part is supported. `parts[0].text` holds the response content.
.TP
.B size_t num_parts
The number of parts in the
.I parts
array.
.TP
.B char* error_message
If an error occurs during the request (either a cURL error or an API error), this member will point to a dynamically allocated string describing the error. It will be `NULL` on success.
.TP
.B long http_status_code
The HTTP status code returned by the server (e.g., 200 for OK, 401 for Unauthorized).
.TP
.B char* finish_reason
A string indicating why the model stopped generating tokens (e.g., "stop", "max_tokens").
