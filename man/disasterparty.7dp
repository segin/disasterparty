.SH NAME
disasterparty \- overview of the Disaster Party LLM client library

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B Disaster Party
library provides a C interface for interacting with Large Language Model (LLM)
APIs, currently supporting OpenAI-compatible endpoints, the Google Gemini API,
and the Anthropic Claude API. It aims to simplify common tasks such as sending text
or multimodal prompts and handling both regular (blocking) and streaming responses.

The library is designed to be relatively simple to integrate and use, leveraging
.BR libcurl (3)
for HTTP(S) communication and
.BR cJSON (3)
for robust JSON parsing and generation.

Key features include:
.IP \(bu 2
Support for OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude APIs.
.IP \(bu 2
Support for text-only and multimodal (text + image URL/base64) inputs.
.IP \(bu 2
Handling of both non-streaming (full response at once) and streaming (token-by-token) completions.
.IP \(bu 2
A dedicated, detailed streaming callback for Anthropic's event-based stream.
.IP \(bu 2
Interface for listing available models from the supported providers.
.IP \(bu 2
Helper functions for constructing request messages and serializing/deserializing conversations to/from JSON or files.
.IP \(bu 2
Management of API contexts and response data.

.SH SYNOPSIS
To use the Disaster Party library in your C program, include the main header file:
.PP
.B #include <disasterparty.h>
.PP
When compiling and linking, you will typically need to link against
.BR libdisasterparty ,
.BR libcurl ,
and
.BR libcjson .
Using pkg-config is recommended if available:
.PP
.BR gcc my_app.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs disasterparty)

.SH GETTING STARTED
1. Initialize a context using
.BR dp_init_context (3),
   specifying the provider and your API key.
.br
2. Construct your request messages using
.BR dp_message_t
   and helper functions like
   .BR dp_message_add_text_part (3).
.br
3. Configure your request using
.BR dp_request_config_t ,
   setting the model, messages, temperature, etc.
.br
4. Perform the API call using either
.BR dp_perform_completion (3)
   for a blocking response or
.BR dp_perform_streaming_completion (3)
   with a callback for streaming.
.br
5. To list available models, use
.BR dp_list_models (3).
.br
6. Always free allocated resources using functions like
.BR dp_free_response_content (3),
.BR dp_free_model_list (3),
.BR dp_free_messages (3),
   and finally
.BR dp_destroy_context (3).

.SH API FUNCTIONS
The library provides several functions for different operations. Refer to the
individual manual pages in section 3 of the manual for detailed information on
each function.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The library itself does not directly read environment variables for API keys, but
the provided test programs and typical applications using this library often
expect API keys to be set in environment variables such as:
.TP
.B OPENAI_API_KEY
For OpenAI-compatible services.
.TP
.B GEMINI_API_KEY
For Google Gemini services.
.TP
.B ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
For Anthropic Claude services.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I <disasterparty.h>
The main header file to include in your C programs.
.TP
.I libdisasterparty.so
The shared library file.
