# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a comprehensive refactoring of the disasterparty codebase to improve maintainability and harvest valuable components from an abandoned development branch. The project will restructure the monolithic source file into multiple focused files, integrate missing tests from the test-expansions branch, and clean up the repository by removing the abandoned branch.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the source code to be split into multiple focused files, so that the codebase is more maintainable and doesn't overwhelm AI models with large single files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the source code is restructured THEN the main disasterparty.c file SHALL be split into multiple logical modules
2. WHEN files are split THEN each module SHALL have a clear, focused responsibility
3. WHEN the restructuring is complete THEN the public API SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN the code is split THEN all existing functionality SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN building the project THEN all modules SHALL compile without warnings using -Wall -Werror

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to harvest useful tests from the abandoned test-expansions branch, so that we don't lose valuable test coverage and regression prevention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the test-expansions branch THEN all tests not present in main SHALL be identified
2. WHEN importing tests THEN they SHALL be adapted to work with the current mainline architecture
3. WHEN tests are imported THEN they SHALL integrate properly with the GNU autotools testsuite
4. WHEN tests are added THEN they SHALL return exit code 77 when skipped
5. WHEN all tests are imported THEN the test-expansions branch SHALL be deleted from the repository

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze the file structure from the test-expansions branch, so that I can apply the same organizational principles to the current codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the test-expansions branch THEN the src/ directory structure SHALL be analyzed
2. WHEN analyzing the structure THEN the organizational principles SHALL be documented
3. WHEN applying the structure THEN it SHALL be adapted to fit the current codebase needs
4. WHEN restructuring is complete THEN the new organization SHALL follow the same logical separation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the repository to be cleaned up after harvesting, so that abandoned code doesn't clutter the project history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all useful components are harvested THEN the test-expansions subdirectory SHALL be deleted
2. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the test-expansions branch SHALL be deleted from the local repository
3. WHEN branch deletion is complete THEN the branch deletion SHALL be pushed to origin
4. WHEN cleanup is finished THEN no traces of the abandoned branch SHALL remain in the working directory

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all changes to be properly committed and documented, so that the refactoring process is tracked and reversible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each major step is completed THEN changes SHALL be committed with descriptive messages
2. WHEN commits are made THEN they SHALL be pushed to the repository
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the README.md SHALL be updated to reflect any structural changes
4. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL accurately describe the new file organization
